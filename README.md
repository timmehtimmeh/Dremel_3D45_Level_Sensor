# Parts required

The following parts are required to replace the PCB

| Part | Qty | Link | Notes|
|------|-----|------|------|
| PCB | 1 | I had the gerbers successfully manufactured at [JLCPCB](https://jlcpcb.com/) as well as [OSHPark*](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/k3kUrSLB) | * **NOTE:** The original Dremel PCB is 1mm thick.  OshPark only makes standard thickness 1.6 mm boards, but the thicker 1.6mm board worked fine in the printer. JLCPCB has options for 1mm thick boards |
| Switch | 1 | The OEM seems to be a [Panasonic ESE-31R15T](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electronic-components/ESE-31R15T/3163183) | An alternate can be the [TE Connectivity JJJHRGG200NOPMRTR](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-alcoswitch-switches/JJJHRGG200NOPMRTR/9452492), but in testing the Panasonic part was less prone to getting stuck in the housing |
| Jumper Wire | 2  | [Wire](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089CWGQKW) |  The OEM is 26 AWG stranded wire, 90 mm, 1 red, one black Outer Diameter (O.D) 1mm. I used the 1.2 mm O.D. 28 AWG silicone coated wire linked, and it still fits inside the cable routing cutouts on the level arm. |
| 2 Position JST-PH 2mm Connector | 1 | [JST Kit](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F485CN38) | I used the kit linked, however you can also buy pre-assembled wires  |

Additionally Soldering equipment (iron, solder), and either Silicone glue, or Hot Glue are needed to complete the job.
