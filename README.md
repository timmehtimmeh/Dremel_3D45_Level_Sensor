# Dremel_3D45_Level_Sensor
KiCAD project, schematic, and gerbers of a PCB replacement for The Auto_LevelBoard printed circuit board (PCB) for the Dremel 3D45 (and possibly the Dremel 3D40)

# Parts required

The following parts are required to replace the PCB
| Part | Qty | Link | Notes|
-----------------------------
| PCB | 1 | I had the gerbers successfully manufactured at (OSHPark*)[] as well as (JLCPCB)[https://jlcpcb.com/] | *The OEM PCB is a 1mm thickness.  OshPark only makes standard thickness 1.6 mm boards, but the standard thickness worked fine. |
| Switch | 1 | The OEM seems to be a (Panasonic ESE-31R15T)[https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/panasonic-electronic-components/ESE-31R15T/3163183] | An alternate can be the (TE Connectivity JJJHRGG200NOPMRTR)[https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/te-connectivity-alcoswitch-switches/JJJHRGG200NOPMRTR/9452492], but in testing the Panasonic part was less prone to getting stuck in the housing |
| Jumper Wire | 2 |  26 AWG stranded wire, 90 mm, 1 red, one black Outer Diameter (O.D) 1mm | (Wire)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089CWGQKW] | I used the 1.2 mm O.D. 28 AWG silicone coated wire linked, and it still fits inside the cable routing cutouts on the level arm. The OEM wire is approximately  |
| 2 Position JST PH Connector | 1 | (JST Kit)[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F485CN38]| I used the kit linked, however the (Engineer PA-09 crimper may be better)[https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002AVVO7K]

Additionally Soldering equipment (iron, solder), and either Silicone glue, or Hot Glue are needed to complete the job.
